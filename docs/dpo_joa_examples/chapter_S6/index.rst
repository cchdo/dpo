Goals
`````
* Compare CTD and bottle T, S, O2, sigma-0
* Compare a single profile (South Atlantic)
* Compare an entire section

To accomplish this, one will
````````````````````````````
* Use and analyze from various sources:

  * Bottle casts
  * CTD casts
  * Statistically-compiled multi-year average data WOA05

* Explore differences in depiction of:

  * Ocean temperature
  * Salinity
  * Dissolved oxygen
  * Density

* Analyze three data types at one location (one profile per data type)
* Analyze vertical section plots from three data types
