Goals
`````
* Explore the physical and chemical characteristics of seawater
* Understand parameters which are calculated from basic measured characteristics
* Explore vertical distributions at a single location in the South Atlantic Ocean
* Examine the regional variations in vertical distributions to be examined in later chapters.
* Learn how to navigate plots

To accomplish this, one will
````````````````````````````
* Open a station file
* Create basic property-property plots
* Create 4 parameter property-property graphs
* Customize plots
* Examine plots

Tools
`````
* JOA built in parameter calculator
* JOA multiple x-axis parameter plotting capabilities
