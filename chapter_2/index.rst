Ocean dimensions, shapes and bottom materials
---------------------------------------------

Goals
`````
* Gain familiarity with the basic geography of the principal ocean basins
* Locate typical ocean sub-regions
* Locate major features of the ocean bottom

To accomplish this, one will
````````````````````````````

* Make maps of the oceans
* Compare maps of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans
* Add bathymetry ('bathy' - deep, of the sea depths; 'meter' - measure) to the maps
* Locate

  * Basins
  * Continental shelves
  * Submarine ridges
  * Inter-basin sills
  * Fracture zones
  * Trenches
  * Seamount/island chains
  * Compare various map projections

The tool used for these examples is the built-in map function in the Java OceanAtlas application.
